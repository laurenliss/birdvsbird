 A game for anyone to play. Ages (motor skills to throw) and up.

## about Bird vs. Bird
My 8-year-old kid and I made up this game because we were (he was) bored and it was *not* ipad time&trade;. It is a combination of:

* [Bags/Baggo/Cornhole]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cornhole")
* [P-I-G / H-O-R_S-E]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variations_of_basketball#H-O-R-S-E")
* [Simon Says]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simon_Says")

... but with a bird companion (or not! play it any way you want! that is the whole point!)

## The Requirements of Bird vs. Bird

* Baggo set
* Beanbags or other, throwable fabric bags (as many as you want)
* A stuffed companion

## The Rules of Bird vs. Bird
1. To play Bird vs. Bird, set up a baggo game. Any version will do; we designed this game with a mini indoor kids one.

2. Pick a companion.

3. Divvy up all bags equally among the participants.

4. Divvy up all participants on either side of the baggo boards.

5. One person goes first: This is called "The Starter". It is the youngest person on the first round, and the player with the most points on subsequent rounds. No player may go first twice in a row. In the event that happens, the player with the least points goes first.

6. On each turn, The Starter chooses to throw any number of bags in any manner they would like to start. Your companion *must* assist in your throw.

7. Other players *must mimic The Starter's exact throw*. If they do not have the necessary level of bags, they can elect to throw only one bag.

8. After all players have thrown, tally the points following Midwestern Baggo Rules:

+3 points for In the Hole (needs illustration / animation*)
+1 point for On The Board 100% (needs illustration / animation*)

addendum: +2 points for A Florpy (needs illustration / animation*). In the event of a bag that is held in place over the edge more than 50% by another bag, this qualifies as A Florpy. Florpies are awarded two points.

9. The game is over whenever you feel like it. Or, follow Midwestern Baggo Rules.
